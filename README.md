# Formulation_Enrichment_Data_Analysis
Dahlman Lab Formulation Enrichment Data Analysis project

This code takes in formulation sheet with barcodes and chemical formulation information of nanoparticles and the normalized counts from sequencing counts. With the users' selection of cell type it returns the enrichment data analysis and the top performing nanoparticles based on the normalized counts.

GUI for this program (Enrichment_interface.py) makes a user friendly way to run this code from the terminal.
